## About me

My name is Georgia Chalvatzaki and I am currently a PhD Candidate at the Intelligent Robotics and Human-Robot Interaction Group in School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), under the supervision of Associate Prof. Costas Tzafestas. I also serve as a research assistant within the Intelligent Robotics and Automation Lab (IRAL) of ICCS. 

My research interests and expertise include human detection and tracking, human-robot interaction and control with applications in the field of assistive robotics. I have especially worked in the development of algorithms for robust on-line human gait tracking and non-intrusive assessment from laser rangefinder data using stochastic estimation techniques for the control of an intelligent robotic walker device for the elderly, in the frames of the MOBOT EU research project. Lately, I have fused information from RGB-D pose estimates in a deep learning framework for gait stability estimation of the elderly users of the robotic rollator. My crrent research focuses on applications of Reinforcemnt Learning for controlling and adapting the motion of the robotic rollator to the particular way of walking of each subject. 

I have also worked as a research assistant in the BabyRobot (H2020) project and assisted in integrating RL decision making mechanisms in Child-Robot interaction scenarios. Now, I am research assistant at i-Walk project, a continuation of the former MOBOT project, aiming to develop an intelliget robotic assistant rollator. This project builds largely on my work about human gait analysis and robot control.

I am a member of the Technical Chamber of Greece since 2013. I am, also, a member of IEEE, IEEE Robotics & Automation Society, IEEE Young Professionals,  IEEE Women in Engineering, IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society.
